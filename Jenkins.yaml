# Define the matrix of which CI tests get run on which repo/distro
# combinations via the Jenkins pipeline defined in the Jenkinsfile.
#
# The structure is:
#   repo:
#     distro:
#       test: value
#
# 'value' should be true or false. Generally a missing test/value pair
# will be seen as a default of false, and the test will not be run.
